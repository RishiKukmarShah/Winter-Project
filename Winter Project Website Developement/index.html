It includes Pashupatinath temple, Swambhunath temple, Muktinath temple, Birthplace of Gautam Buddha, Janki temple. We enjoyed a lot and met with different people from different places. We also got blessings of many saints.  </p>

            <ul>
            <li>FIRST JANUARY CELEBRATION</li>
        </h2>
        <p>When the New Year arrives, the atmosphere is filled with thrill, enthusiasm, newness and happiness. In general, celebration on a massive level is done while celebrating the Gregorian new year, i.e. on 1st January; it is also said to be the new year day as per the Julian calendar. Julius Caesar was the emperor of Rome and was the first to declare 1st January a national holiday. He named the month after the name of the Roman god of doors and gates having two faces (forward and backwards-looking), Janus. Hence, the last night of 31st December is celebrated along with the welcome party of the New Year. The very first New Year was celebrated in Babylon over 4000 years ago. But, it is said to be celebrated on 21st March. At present, it is due to the influence of the west, 1st January is celebrated as the New Year all over the world. The enthusiasm is seen in everyone prior to 2 weeks. Some get excited as soon as the last month (December) starts. Every other person is seen asking about the others' New Year celebration plan and sharing their excitement about the day. Some are seen busy making new resolutions for the New Year. There are very few people who can be seen making their plans for the coming year. A new year marks the beginning of a year of 365 days.</p>

            <li>GET TOGETHER PROGRAM</li>
        </h2>
        <p>After some weeks later my all friends gathered together to meet to each other who lives near my village. I introduced my friends with my all family members. All of them shared their experiences of new year and I also shared my experience with them. Hileshwar told that he had gone on a picnic on the  New year. Shushant told that he had not gone anywhere because of some problems so he celebrated the New year at the home and enjoyed. Then I told that 'I celebrated by going on a small picnic with my whole familly and 'also by staying at home'. That day was very enjoyful, I would not forgert that day. That day we also went on a coffee shop. Then all of them told me 'see you tomorrow in the school'. then I also told them 'bye'. While saying goog bye I gave gifts to all of them then they told me thank you. Really! that day I enjoyed a lot. </p>

        </H2>
        <P>The time with my family is so special but I appreciate when they are gone from the house so I can have it to myself. I love making miniature campfires in the backyard which is the largest in the neighborhood. The wind blows throughout the trees and the smoke gently sifts vertically up toward the canopy.These are some of my favorite times I remember Just sitting on my bed, Innocent and wondering about nothing I would hear the rain fall from the sky and the cars moving through the rain where the ireâ€™s would sift the water to either side of them. What an awesome feeling the rain can make. It is not a bad feeling. Its not a depressing feeling.

It is a feeling of youth. And not caring about anything other than where the rain is coming from. Just sitting on my cold bed I have a weird feeling of warmth.As I have the comfort of the fireplace downstairs warming the house In such a natural way. As If It does not matter how wet you get or how low one can go the fire In Its secure position makes me feel secure. And when I get wet from the water from the sky, the fire will dry away he cold In my bones. The sound of rain Is one that Is hard to explain.</P>
